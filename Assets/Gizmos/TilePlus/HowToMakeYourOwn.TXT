To apply this icon (or any other) to any of your subclasses
 of TilePlusBase so that custom icons show up in inspectors:

Using a namespace:
create a subfolder under 'Assets/Gizmos' with the name of your
namespace (as is here, in Assets/Gizmos/TilePlus). 

{So don't put them in this folder or it won't work. Unless for 
some reason you used this namespace for your code instead of
using a 'using' statement.}

Place a .png file with the icon in that folder.

Without a namespace: place the png in the Assets/Gizmos folder.

Naming: name of your asset <space> Icon

example:  MyCustomTileClassName Icon

the space between the end of the class name and the word Icon 
(not icon, must be Icon) is important.


Note: keep it small, like 64x64, and obviously this applies to
any custom asset. Import should have Texture Type set to
Editor GUI and Legacy GUI
